        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Sushi is a beautifully balanced Japanese dish that combines vinegared rice with fresh, flavorful ingredients like seafood, vegetables, and seaweed. This version focuses on <strong>maki rolls</strong>, where rice and fillings are rolled in sheets of <strong>nori</strong> (seaweed) and sliced into bite-sized pieces. The result is a visually appealing, customizable dish that’s both light and satisfying. With its clean flavors and delicate texture, sushi is as much about the experience of preparation as it is about taste.</p>
            <p>Making sushi at home is easier than it seems—especially when using cooked fillings like crab, shrimp, or vegetables. Once the rice is properly seasoned and cooled, the rolling process becomes a fun and creative activity. You can keep it traditional or experiment with ingredients like cream cheese, mango, or spicy mayo. Whether served as an elegant appetizer or the main event, homemade sushi is a fresh, interactive meal that brings restaurant-quality results to your own kitchen.</p>

                <li>Prepare Fillings
